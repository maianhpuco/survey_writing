      "Goals": [
        "Demonstrate 15% bias reduction in oncology diagnostics using SHAP",
        "Achieve 80% provider confidence in LIME-explained radiology results",
        "Deploy 2 HIPAA/GDPR-compliant XAI pilots with audit trails",
        "Secure 2 EHR vendor partnerships for toolkit integration within 12 months",
        "Deliver training programs with 80% stakeholder satisfaction",

        "2. XAI Foundations: Core principles, LIME/SHAP methodologies, and ethical imperatives",
        "3. Technical Challenges: Model interpretability vs accuracy trade-offs; federated learning for privacy",
        "4. Case Studies: (a) SHAP-driven oncology bias reduction (b) LIME in radiology interpretability (c) Hybrid cardiology predictive models",
        "5. Trust Ecosystem: Framework linking XAI outputs to clinical trust metrics (provider/patient scores)",
        "6. Regulatory Compliance: Anonymization protocols, audit logs for HIPAA/GDPR alignment",

      "completeness": "The plan comprehensively addresses XAI's technical, ethical, and regulatory dimensions. It covers core methods (LIME/SHAP/decision trees), quantifiable case studies, regulatory alignment (GDPR/FDA), and actionable strategies. Success metrics include compliance validation, prototype testing, clinician training, and interoperability tools, ensuring all critical aspects are addressed.",
      "clarity": "The structure is logical and well-organized, progressing from foundational concepts to implementation and future directions. However, some sections (e.g., 'Trust Ecosystem') could benefit from clearer connections to technical methods or case studies. Explicitly linking case studies in Section 5 to earlier methodological sections would enhance coherence.",
      "feasibility": "Resources like FDA guidelines, GDPR checklists, and recent case studies (IBM Watson, DeepMind) are credible and accessible. Success metrics like prototype testing in two institutions and clinician training are achievable. However, validating compliance with three independent ethics boards and achieving 90% user satisfaction may require additional resources or phased timelines. The open-source toolkit adoption target (5+ EHR vendors) is ambitious but feasible with strategic partnerships.",
      "score": 88,
      "recommendations": "1. Strengthen Section 3 ('Trust Ecosystem') by explicitly linking bias mitigation techniques (e.g., SHAP for fairness analysis) to case studies. 2. Clarify how each case study in Section 5 demonstrates the methods discussed in Section 2. 3. Adjust feasibility of '3 ethics boards' to a phased approach (e.g., 1-2 initial boards) and reduce the 90% training satisfaction threshold to 80% for initial phases. 4. Add a timeline for EHR vendor collaboration to address the toolkit adoption metric."
